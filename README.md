# Leeds-ManifoldTesting

A Geometric Processing program for spcific courework, and test the input file is a 2-manifold or not in the end.

It is a command line tool, with no visualizations.


## Build and Run
It seems lost some files and should be fixed and improved.
The basic file is in the `./dev` folder.
```bash
cd dev/triangle_renderer
mkdir build 
cmake ..
```
